# YTDraws Chess Server
A completely custom server implementation written in about 2 hours. It should support everything hopefully.
One thing to note is that the server ignores recaptcha authentication, I couldn't be bothered. You still have to send it, however you can just send a bogus key starting with "0."

## There's also a `chess.ytdraws.win` directory, which contains a slightly modified client to remove recaptcha jargon.
